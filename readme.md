## Description

Developers Best Friend is a Laravel 5.1 web app that generates three helpful resources for web developers:
- Up to 10 paragraphs of lorem ipsum filler text
- Random users: includes a name, username, and email address by default. Mailing address (US), phone number, birthday (all generated users are above the age of 13), profile text, and profile photo are optional. Random user data can also be downloaded as JSON or as a CSV file.
- XKCD-style passwords: a string of words, plus an optional number and/or symbol, to serve as a more easily memorable password. Options include "memorable mode," which outputs a string consisting of an adjective, noun, verb, and adverb for a "grammatically correct" password, and "dinosaur mode," which outputs a password containing a dinosaur. (Note: a similar tool built in plain PHP is at https://github.com/rebekahheacock/dwa15-p2)

All forms include both HTML5 validation and Laravel-based validation with custom error messages.
